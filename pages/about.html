                <h2>Hello! I'm Chad</h2>
                <p>Hello There! I'm Chadric M. Gotis and I am a Web developer! Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Wesleyan University-Philippines, Maria Aurora, Aurora Campus. And by God's grace I got the "Programmer of the Year" award and "Best in Research" award which is I am very proud of. As soon as I graduated at the said school, immediately I looked for a job which I can start of. And luckily my first job is being a teacher at Wesleyan University-Philippines, the school where I graduated. I worked as a High school teacher and College instructor for 2 years, and what else can I say? It's fun. Let's say being a teacher is hard, but I think it is very rewarding that you can share your knowledge and ideas. It's like planting a seed into their minds and after a year you can see them bloom and prosper, and guess what? You are part of it. But I think my teaching years has passed. I totally fell inlove with programming and web development, it is my passion. And I think I am willing to take a risk to chase my dream. To become a successful Developer. </p>
